## Maps tweaks

### Colored map lands by tiers

Add a colored border by tier (Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary) to the blockfarm map.

## My lands tweaks

Script: `blockfarm-lands-tweaks.js`

This scripts adds a color to the plants (red or green) to let you know what plants can be harvested before the next exchange day (next tuesday) Green plants can be harvested before and red plants cannot.

This scripts also adds a floating button on the botton right that generates a ical file (Calendar file) with events on the date and hour each plant in the current land is due to harvest. After downloading the file, you just need to import it in any calendar (Like google calendar) and you can have a reminder when you need to harvest a plant.
